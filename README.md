A very simple first try at an Alexa skill that is hosted on Azure (or anywhere, just not AWS Lambda) and written in .Net.
It's a great starting point for anyone that wants to learn how to communicate with Alexa over a web service using Microsoft technologies.

There's a great litte Alexa Skill package for .Net available through Nuget which you can check out here:
